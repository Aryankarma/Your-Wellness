"Your wellness" is a digital platform designed to improve the healthcare sector in India. It connects patients and doctors, providing a centralized platform for managing medical records, appointments, accessing medical documents of patients, and communicating with healthcare providers. In this project I used technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and APIs like Google Maps makes it a good solution for the challenges faced by the healthcare sector. Some modern Animations are also used in this project.
